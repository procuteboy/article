abstract = "Investigations of deconfined quark matter within NJL-type models are reviewed, focusing on the regime of low temperatures and “moderate” densities, which is not accessible by perturbative QCD. Central issue is the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration and the formation of color superconducting phases. In order to lay a solid ground for this analysis, we begin with a rather detailed discussion of two- and three-flavor NJL models and their phase structure, neglecting the possibility of diquark pairing in a first step. An important aspect of this part is a comparison with the MIT bag model. The NJL model is also applied to investigate the possibility of absolutely stable strange quark matter. In the next step the formalism is extended to include diquark condensates. We discuss the role and mutual influence of several conventional and less conventional quark–antiquark and diquark condensates. As a particularly interesting example, we analyze a spin-1 diquark condensate as a possible pairing channel for those quarks which are left over from the standard spin-0 condensate. For three-flavor systems, we find that a self-consistent calculation of the strange quark mass, together with the diquark condensates, is crucial for a realistic description of the 2SC–CFL phase transition. We also study the effect of neutrality constraints which are of relevance for compact stars. Both, homogeneous and mixed, neutral phases are constructed. Although neutrality constraints generally tend to disfavor the 2SC phase we find that this phase is again stabilized by the large values of the dynamical strange quark mass which follow from the self-consistent treatment. Finally, we combine our solutions with existing hadronic equations of state to investigate the existence of quark matter cores in neutron stars."

abstract = "Instantons generate strong nonperturbative interactions between quarks. In vacuum, these interactions lead to chiral symmetry breaking and generate constituent quark masses on the order of 300–400MeV. The observation that the same forces also provide attraction in the scalar diquark channel leads to the prediction that cold quark matter is a color superconductor, with gaps as large as ∼100MeV. We provide a systematic treatment of color superconductivity in the instanton model. We show that the structure of the superconductor depends on the number of flavors. In the case of two flavors, we verify the standard scenario, and provide an improved calculation of the mass gap. For three flavors, we show that the ground state is color–flavor locked and calculate the chiral condensate in the high-density phase. We show that as a function of the strange quark mass, there is a sharp transition between the two phases. Finally, we go beyond the mean-field approximation and investigate the role of instanton/anti-instanton molecules, which—in addition to superconducting gap formation—provide a competitive mechanism for chiral restoration at finite density."

abstract = "The phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at nonzero temperature and baryon chemical potential is calculated within a three-flavor NJL-type quark model with realistic quark masses. The model exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking as well as diquark condensation in the two-flavor color-superconducting phase and in the color–flavor-locked phase. We investigate the color–flavor-unlocking phase transition, taking into account self-consistently calculated effective quark masses. We find that it is mainly triggered by a first-order phase transition with respect to the strange-quark mass. It takes place at much higher values of the chemical potential than the transition to the hadronic phase such that we find a relatively large region in the phase diagram where the two-flavor color-superconductor seems to be the most favored state."

  abstract={Ever since Witten's paper on superconducting cosmic strings, there has been an interest in strings with a non-trivial core structure. In particular, it is believed that such strings can form loops, known as vortons, which are stabilized against shrinking by current and charge trapped on the string world-sheet. In this paper, we show that analogous non-trivial vortices and stable vortex loops exist in non-relativistic two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In contrast with well-studied superfluid 4 He, where similar vortex rings can be stable due to Magnus force only if they move, the vortex rings in two-component BECs can be stable even if they are at rest. We speculate that such vortons may have been already observed in the laboratory. Thus, it may be possible to test predictions regarding vortons in cosmology and astrophysics by doing controlled experiments in two-component BECs.}

The rotated magnetic field B˜ is introduced, not only accounting for the unbroken symmetry with the rotated electric charge, but also resulting in new effects for the collective excitations such as the Nambu–Goldstone and Higgs modes. In particular, it is found that the masses of Higgs octet are no longer degenerated and part of them acquire the magnetic-induced contribution. To the leading order in the applied field, we construct an effective Ginzburg–Landau formalism through these B˜-related masses. As the application, we investigate magnetic responses of the non-Abelian vortices arising from color–flavor-locked symmetry breaking pattern. The B˜-field dependence of their spatial configurations and tension energies are calculated for the first time."

Using a quark model with a four-fermion interaction, we identify diquark excitations as poles of the microscopically computed diquark propagator. The quark masses are obtained by solving a dynamical equation for the chiral condensate and are found to determine the stability of the diquark excitations. The stability of diquark excitations is investigated in the T–μ plane for different values of the diquark coupling strength. We find that diquark bound states appear at small quark chemical potentials and at intermediate coupling strengths. Bose–Einstein condensation of non-strange diquark states occurs when the attractive interaction between quarks is sufficiently strong."
